# Mess-Management-System-Reactjs

In this application, we have used the React JS and the Advance concepts of the React JS to make a Management system with the admin and the user dashboards and with the beautiful UI/UX designs. We have used the AntDesign for this application.
I have build this application from scratch for the learning purpose. All the design of UI and UX are designed with the projects implementations.
